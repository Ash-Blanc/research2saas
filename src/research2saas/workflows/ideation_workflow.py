"""
Application Ideation Workflow
Multi-agent pipeline that connects research paper ideas to real-world problems

Architecture:
- Phase 1: Parallel Research (3 agents gather raw material)
- Phase 2: Iterative Ideation Loop (progressively creative thinking)
- Phase 3: Cross-Domain Synthesis (connect dots, rank ideas)
